# Charades word lists

Every deck the game offers is a plain text file here, one folder per language:

```
words/
  en/
    animals.txt
    act-it-out.txt
    …
```

The build compiles every file into the game (`build.rs`), so adding a deck or a language means
adding files and changing no code. The lists were written for this project and are licensed like
the rest of the repository.

## The file format

UTF-8 text, one entry per line. Blank lines are skipped, and a line starting with `#` is a comment,
except for two header lines that name the deck in its own language:

```
# title: Animals
# blurb: From aardvarks to zebras.
Aardvark
Albatross
```

The file name is the deck's **id**: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens. The id stays the same in
every language. Saved progress, best scores and the deck's color are keyed by it, and
`ORDER` in `src/model.rs` sets the order decks are offered in. A deck whose id is not in `ORDER`
comes after the listed ones, alphabetically, and gets a color from the id.

`cargo test -p charades` checks every file in every language: a title and a blurb, at least 100
entries, no entry listed twice (ignoring case), none longer than 40 characters, and no stray spaces.
The English decks together must hold at least 3,000 entries.

## What goes in a deck

- Things a group can describe, act out or hum within a few seconds, and that most players know.
- Family-friendly: nothing a parent would skip past at a family gathering.
- No product or company brand names, and no living people. Titles of well-known films and books
  are fine, as are historical figures, characters from works in the public domain, and folklore.
- Natural capitalization: `Hot dog`, `Eiffel Tower`, `Brushing your teeth`.

## Other languages

A language gets its own lists, written for its players rather than translated. A word that is
common in one language can be obscure in another, and film titles, sayings, holidays and famous
people differ between cultures. So:

1. **Folder.** Create `words/<tag>/`, where `<tag>` is the language (`fr`, `de`, `ja`) or a
   regional variant (`pt-BR`, `es-MX`) when the lists need to differ by region.
2. **Decks.** Start from the English ids, since players recognize the colors across languages, but
   write each list fresh. Leave out a deck that doesn't travel, like `sayings`, until it has a
   native list, and add decks that only make sense in that language under a new id.
3. **Titles.** Put each deck's title and blurb in that language in its header. The rest of the
   game's text (buttons, rules, results) is translated in the Fluent catalogs under
   `games/charades/resource/locales/<tag>/app.ftl` (relative to the app root), using
   Charades' own generated `res::str` accessors, as for every other game.
4. **Check.** Run `cargo test -p charades`, then play a round with the app set to that language.

The game picks its word lists from the app's language as it opens a deck: the exact tag, then the
language alone (`fr-CA` uses `fr-CA/`, then `fr/`), then English. Chinese script/region tags such as `zh-Hans-CN` use the `zh-CN` lists. A player whose
language has no lists yet plays in English.

The current collection includes animal and food decks in Arabic, German, Spanish, French,
Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian and Simplified
Chinese. Each has at least 100 prompts and its own title and blurb. English retains all 21
themes; translated players see their language's two decks, without English prompts mixed in.

Possible future extensions:

- **Choosing a word list.** When more than one language is available, Settings will offer the
  word-list language separately from the app's, for mixed-language groups and learners.
- **Right-to-left scripts.** Arabic and Hebrew decks draw through the same text path as the rest of
  the app's text, which shapes and orders them. A first right-to-left list should be checked on a
  device before it ships.
- **Size.** English is about 40 KB of text. Once many languages ship, the lists can move to data
  assets under `resource/assets/words/<tag>/` and be read when a deck opens, so a phone only
  loads its own language. The file format stays the same, and so does this folder layout.
