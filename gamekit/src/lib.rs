//! gamekit is the games' standard save-state mechanism. Each game serializes its durable state
//! (board, score, best) to JSON in `day-part-prefs` (docs/prefs.md) and restores it the next
//! time it opens. Two write triggers cover every exit path:
//!
//! - **game exit**: [`autosave`] hooks the page scope's cleanup, so closing the cover (the X
//!   button, system back, a route change) saves, on every backend, ArkUI included;
//! - **app backgrounding**: one process-wide set of lifecycle handlers
//!   (`DidEnterBackground` / `WillResignActive` / `WillTerminate`, where the backend delivers
//!   them; docs/lifecycle.md) saves every open game.
//!
//! [`on_background`] rides the same lifecycle handlers for a game that wants to react to
//! leaving the foreground (a timed game pauses its clock) before its state is saved.
//!
//! [`chrome`] is the shell every game shares: the pause menu, the results cards, the
//! settings and how-to-play sheets, the pause button, and the haptic gate.
