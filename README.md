# Day Games

Solitaire, Block Blast, Breakout, falling blocks, Sudoku, 2048, Mines, Charades, Reversi, and Pipes in one app. Built with
[Day](https://daybrite.dev) in one Rust codebase and rendered with the platform's own widgets on
iPhone, Android, HarmonyOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, and the web. Every game runs entirely on the
device, and your progress is saved when you leave a game and restored when you come back.

## Run it in one command

Install the `day` CLI, then let it clone, build, and launch the app on your desktop:

```sh
cargo install day-cli
day launch --git https://github.com/daybrite/Day-Games.git
```

With no `-p`, the CLI picks the host's own toolkit (`macos-appkit`, `windows-xaml`, `linux-gtk`).
Name a target to run elsewhere: `-p ios-uikit` for a booted Simulator, `-p android-mdc` for a
running emulator or device, `-p harmony-arkui` for HarmonyOS, `-p web-dom` to serve the browser
build. `day doctor` lists what each toolkit needs and prints the install command for anything
missing. The launch prints where it put the checkout, so you can open the code and change it.

To rename a fork, change `[app].title` in `Day.toml`. The home header and window title use
that metadata automatically. `day build --flavor <name>` also honors the title in
`Day-<name>.toml` and platform/toolkit overrides; a plain Cargo build uses the base title.

## The games

- **Solitaire.** Klondike, turning the stock one card at a time or three. With Winnable Deals
  Only on, a solver plays every deal through to a win before it reaches the table, and Hint
  shows a move on a winning line. Drag or tap cards; once every card is face up, the rest fly
  home by themselves, and a win sends the whole deck bouncing off the table.
- **Block Blast.** Drag pieces from a tray of three onto an 8×8 board and fill rows and columns
  to clear them. A preview lights up the lines a drop would clear, clears on consecutive
  placements build a combo worth up to four times the points, emptying the board pays a
  5,000-point bonus, and three difficulties decide how reliably the tray deals pieces that fit.
- **Breakout.** Clear the bricks with a paddle that glides under your finger and can smash the
  ball up or down. Quick successive breaks multiply the score, armored bricks arrive on later
  levels, and five power-ups drop from marked bricks: a wider paddle, a slower ball, a ball
  that smashes straight through, extra balls, and an extra life.
- **Falling blocks.** The one you already know how to play, with the next piece shown, lines
  clearing in a flash, and the pieces coming quicker as the level climbs.
- **Sudoku.** Four difficulties, pencil marks, unlimited undo and redo, a checkpoint you can
  commit or revert, hints where the difficulty allows them, and a best time per difficulty.
- **2048.** Slide the tiles, watch them merge, and chase your best score. Reaching 2048 is not
  the end unless you want it to be.
- **Mines.** The sweeper you know, with the sharp edges filed off: your first tap is always safe
  and opens a clearing, holding a square plants a flag (or turn on Flag Mode and tap), and tapping
  a number that already has its flags opens the rest around it. Three board sizes, each turning
  with the window so the squares stay big enough to hit on a phone, and a best time for each.
- **Pipes.** Rotate tiles to connect every branch to the gold source. Choose a 5×5, 7×7,
  or 9×9 generated puzzle; lock tiles to protect them, and watch a wave of light cross the
  completed network. Every puzzle is solvable. Saves include rotations and locks, and each
  board size keeps its fewest-rotation record. Arrows select, Space/Enter rotates, and L locks.
- **Reversi.** Trap and flip opposing discs on an 8×8 board. Play Black against three
  computer difficulties or share the board in pass-and-play. Legal moves are marked, flips
  animate, and a side with no move passes automatically. Use arrows and Space/Enter on a
  keyboard. The game ends when neither side can move; the larger disc count wins.
- **Charades.** The party game for a phone on your forehead: your friends give clues, you nod
  when you guess right and tip your head back to pass, and the phone reads the tilt. Decks run
  from animals and movies to sayings and things to act out, no word repeats until its deck is
  played through, and the screen stays on for the whole round. Without a motion sensor, rounds
  use Correct and Pass buttons. The word lists live in `games/charades/words/`, one folder per
  language; its README explains the format and how another language gets its own lists.

Every game has the same shell: a pause button, a menu to resume, start over, open the
settings, or reread the rules, and a results card with your score or the outcome. The rules open by
themselves the first time you play a game. Each game plays sound effects timed to its haptics,
and its settings have a Sounds switch and a Vibrations switch. With a mouse or trackpad the Breakout paddle follows the pointer across the field
and the cursor hides while it does; the arrow keys move the paddle, the piece, the tiles, or
the Sudoku selection. In Block Blast, 1 to 3 pick up a piece, the arrows move it, and the same
number drops it. In Solitaire, 1 to 7 pick a column and another of those digits moves it there,
8 picks the waste, 9 sends a card home, and 0 turns the stock. In Charades, ↓ or Return scores
a card and ↑ passes it. In Mines, the arrows move the pointer, Space or Return uncovers, and F
plants a flag.

The home screen is a grid of tiles that fills the window's width and adds a column whenever
the window has room for another tile. Each preview is drawn by the game's own crate with the same code that renders gameplay. Tapping a tile presents the game in a fullscreen cover with an X
to exit. On the phones the games defer the system's edge gestures and disable interactive
dismissal, so an edge swipe mid-game stays in the game.

Everything runs on the device with nothing to sign in to and nothing shown but the game. Each
game is a self-contained crate with physics on the frame clock and a serde save state.

## Build from a clone

Day compiles one toolkit backend per binary, so name a target when you build or launch. Every
target the app ships is listed in `Day.toml`.

```sh
day doctor                       # toolchains present and missing, with fixes
day launch -p macos-appkit       # the Mac's own toolkit (macos-gtk and macos-qt run here too)
day launch -p ios-uikit          # needs a booted Simulator
day launch -p android-mdc        # needs a JDK and a running emulator or device
day launch -p harmony-arkui      # needs the OpenHarmony SDK and an emulator
day launch -p web-dom            # builds the wasm bundle and serves it to your browser
day build  -p windows-xaml       # build only (Windows builds on a Windows host)
```

To build from plain cargo, pass the backend feature yourself, for example
`cargo build --features appkit`; a bare `cargo build` enables no backend and will not link.

[Dayscripts](https://daybrite.dev/docs/dayscript) drive the app: `smoke.yaml` opens each
game, `sudoku.yaml` walks every Sudoku surface, `blockblast.yaml` places Block Blast pieces
from the keyboard and walks its menus, `reversi.yaml` checks captures, solo play, menus, and save restoration;
`pipes.yaml` checks locks, saves, all board sizes, and a complete seeded solution;
`solitaire.yaml` plays a proven-winnable deal from the
keyboard, and `bk.yaml` and `games.yaml` sweep gameplay for screenshots:

```sh
day launch -p ios-uikit --script dayscript/games.yaml
```

## Inside the code

- `src/lib.rs` is `root()`: the home grid and the fullscreen cover each game opens in, with typed
  routes so deep links and dayscript can open a game by name.
- `games/blockblast`, `games/breakout`, `games/sirtet`, `games/solitaire`, `games/sudoku`, `games/reversi`, `games/pipes`, and
  `games/twentyfortyeight` are one crate per game: canvas or grid-layout UI, physics on the
  frame clock, and a serde save state.
- `gamekit/` is the shared persistence layer: each game's state is saved when its cover closes
  or the app is backgrounded, and restored the next time it opens. A game that keeps a clock
  can also hook the backgrounding itself, which is how Sudoku pauses.
- Each game and `gamekit` owns its `resource/locales/<locale>/*.ftl` catalogs and generated
  `res::str` accessors; the app root keeps identity and permission text. See
  [localization](docs/localization.md).
- `platform/` holds the thin native host projects the Apple, Android, and HarmonyOS targets
  build through.

`day lint` checks routes, element ids, and locale coverage.

For Android cover hit testing, launch on a 360×640dp emulator with
`day launch -p android-mdc --android-device SERIAL --env DAY_GAMES_SEED=15 --keep-alive`,
then run `python3 scripts/android-cover-touch-test.py SERIAL` with `adb` on PATH.
This uses native screen taps to check that passive game headers cannot activate the hidden
home grid, while pause, close, and the home tiles still respond. Ordinary dayscript taps
address a node directly and cannot detect this form of touch-through.

## Languages

All ten games have interface translations in 13 languages, including Arabic and Simplified
Chinese. See [localization](docs/localization.md) for the locale list, translated Charades
decks, store metadata and browser testing.
